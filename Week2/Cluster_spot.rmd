  ####You will first need to load in the data. *Remember to first set your working directory to where you have saved the data.*
  
  ```{r}
#setwd("folderLocationOfData")
top50 <- read_csv("top50playlists.csv")
```

#We can do some basic 

```{r}
top50 %>% dplyr::count(track_name, sort=TRUE)
```
*You may notice we are using the dplyr package above and knitr package below but didn't install these when loading in our packages, this is because we loaded in the tidyverse package which installs a whole suite of packages including these ones, this is a great way to make sure you have everything you need if you are going to be using tidy coding approaches.*

```{r}
knitr::kable(top50) %>%
kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), font_size = 12) %>%
scroll_box(width = "720px", height = "500px")
```
